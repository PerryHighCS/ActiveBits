## Entries

- Date: 2026-03-04
- Environment: production
- Change: `video-sync` now stores unsynced-student telemetry in a Valkey-backed per-session key when `VALKEY_URL` is configured, instead of relying only on in-process maps.
- Risk: If Valkey is unavailable, cross-instance `telemetry.sync.unsyncedStudents` coherence degrades back to single-instance behavior, though normal playback sync still functions.
- Rollback approach: Revert the `video-sync` unsynced-student persistence change in `activities/video-sync/server/routes.ts` and redeploy.
- Evidence (runbook/logs/path): `activities/video-sync/server/routes.ts`; `activities/video-sync/server/routes.test.ts`; `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Follow-up action: If other realtime activities need short-lived cross-instance telemetry state, extract a shared helper rather than duplicating activity-local Valkey key logic.
