## Discoveries

- Date: 2026-02-23
- Area: tooling
- Discovery: Upgrading `client`/`server` to `eslint@10` is currently blocked by `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`. The latest published `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.0.1` still declares a peer dependency range that supports ESLint up to `^9.0.0`, so `npm install` fails with `ERESOLVE` before lint can run.
- Why it matters: Future dependency update attempts may incorrectly assume ESLint 10 is ready because `npm outdated` shows newer `eslint` and `@eslint/js` versions. This saves time and avoids forced installs on the main branch.
- Evidence: `client/package.json`; `server/package.json`; `npm install --include=dev --workspaces --include-workspace-root` (ERESOLVE peer conflict); `npm view eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest version peerDependencies --json`
- Follow-up action: Re-check `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` peer support for ESLint 10 on the next dependency refresh, then retry the ESLint 10 bump in a separate commit.
