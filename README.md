# RaffleTickets
An in class exploration of algorithms using raffle tickets as an example. 

 * Search algorithms can be introduced by hosting a 'raffle', having the class get tickets, choosing a winner, then searching for that winner.
 * Reasonable vs Unreasonable time algorithms can be explored with the pair and group
 raffles, with students trying to find the tickets that add up to the winning total.
