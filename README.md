# ActiveBits

ActiveBits is a classroom-focused platform for interactive computer science activities.  
Teachers can launch live sessions, share join links, and guide students through hands-on exercises in real time.

Current activity areas include:
- Raffle-based search and problem-solving activities
- Network and web-systems simulations
- Algorithm demonstrations
- Java and Python practice activities
- Solo practice modes for independent student work
