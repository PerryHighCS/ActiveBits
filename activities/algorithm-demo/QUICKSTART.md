# Algorithm Demo Activity - Quick Start

## 🎯 For Instructors

### Setup
1. Start a new session: Go to your teacher dashboard
2. Click "Algorithm Demonstrations"
3. Share the session ID with students

### Demo a Sorting Algorithm
1. Students join the session
2. Click algorithm picker, select "Selection Sort"
3. Use "Next Step" button to advance
4. Watch pseudocode highlight in real-time
5. All students see the same visualization
6. Click "Generate New Array" to restart with new data

### Demo Binary Search
1. Select "Binary Search"
2. Algorithm displays target number
3. Click "Next Step" to divide the search space
4. Notice eliminated elements fade out
5. Watch as algorithm converges on target

### Interactive Guessing Game
1. Select "Binary Search Guessing Game"
2. Enter guesses and click "Guess"
3. Get feedback (higher/lower)
4. Students watch and count how many guesses it takes
5. Great for showing binary search efficiency!

## 🎓 For Students (Shared Session)

1. Join with session ID from instructor
2. Watch the algorithm visualization
3. Follow along with pseudocode highlighting
4. Read step descriptions showing what's happening
5. Ask questions - no interaction needed

---

## 🎓 For Students (Solo Mode)

1. Go to main page → Click "Solo Bits"
2. Find "Algorithm Practice" 
3. Choose an algorithm to explore
4. You control the step-through:
   - "Next Step" - advance one step
   - "Reset" - restart algorithm
   - "Generate New Array" - new data
5. Practice at your own pace
6. Progress saved to your browser

## 📊 Available Algorithms

| Algorithm | Category | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Selection Sort | Sorting | Finding minimum, swapping |
| Insertion Sort | Sorting | Building sorted structure |
| Binary Search | Search | Efficient searching |
| Linear Search | Search | Comparing to binary search |
| Factorial | Recursion | Call stack, unwinding |
| Guessing Game | Interactive | Demonstrating efficiency |

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

- **How sorting works**: See comparisons and swaps
- **Search efficiency**: Binary vs. linear
- **Recursion**: Watch the call stack grow and shrink
- **Algorithm efficiency**: Observe the number of steps
- **Problem-solving**: Interactive guessing game

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Pause and discuss**: Between steps, ask students what happens next
- **Compare algorithms**: Run linear search, then binary search on same data
- **Try edge cases**: Single element, all same values, worst case
- **Real-world parallels**: Guessing game like real binary search applications

---

## 🚀 Troubleshooting

**Not seeing the algorithm?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing page
- Make sure session ID is correct

**Visualization looks wrong?**
- Clear browser cache
- Try different algorithm first, then return
- Check that all students are on same page

**In solo mode, can't change algorithm?**
- Click "Switch Algorithm" button
- Or refresh page to reset

**Stuck on a step?**
- Click "Reset" to restart
- Select a different algorithm to practice

## 🎓 Class Activities

### 1. Sorting Race
- Show selection sort (O(n²))
- Show insertion sort (O(n²))
- Count steps - discuss why similar complexity
- Show with nearly-sorted data

### 2. Search Showdown
- Binary search: ~7 steps for 1000 items
- Linear search: could be 1000 steps
- Students vote on which is faster before demo

### 3. Recursion Discovery
- Show factorial computation
- Watch call stack build up
- See how results combine coming back down
- Discuss base cases

### 4. Efficiency Challenge
- Students predict: how many guesses needed for binary search?
- Usually guess too high
- Demonstrate logarithmic efficiency

---

## 📚 Connected Learning

- Compare pseudocode with actual implementation
- Pause and draw on whiteboard
- Have students write pseudocode before seeing demo
- Discuss trade-offs (time vs. space, simplicity vs. efficiency)
